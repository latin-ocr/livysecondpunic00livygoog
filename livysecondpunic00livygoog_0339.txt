3. satin: = satisne, familiar to colloquial language, to be taken
with per commodum.

4. proiecto: certainly aot conceived without reason, as Hannibal
thought.

b. et: corresponds to et before adventu—indutias: the Car-
thaginians had arranged an armistioe so as to gain time until
Hannibal should return, and as soon as he was near at hand had
violated the agreement— qnam: ie. si integer peteret pacem,
aequiora impetrari posse quom si victus peteret. - integer: = iri
chius. ·

6. id: the construction is irregular‚ for we should expect some
expression which the indireot question should follow like iacer-
tum est, or mibi porum compertum est, followed by a acm with
neutrum . . . habeo—neutrum . . .habeo: abridged expres-
sion for noa habeo, cur alterum utrum adfirmem.

7. primo: a first battle, between Hannibal and Scipio to which
Zama would be the second. The implication is that this unsuo-
oessful contest referred to by Valerius Antias influenoed Hannibal

1. armatis: the armed escort—singulis: each with an in-
terpreter.

3. tum: supply dixit. —primus: who first waged war against
the Roman people. This is of course strikingly inexact unless we
understand him as saying that he was the first, whether Cartha-
ginian or Roman, to make an attach-victoriam: Hannibal
does not mean in individual battles but of the war in general.
-is: in apposition to the subject of venirem, ie. such an one ·
as l have described. — ultro: uoluntarily.

4. fuerit: future perfect, the subjecta are Hannibalem. . .
cessisse, and te . . . ferrem imposuisse. Note the parallelism with
the preceding sentence. ⁸
