1. nemini: no one fell lbal a aas necessary ιο reply ιο bis speech.
—adeo: in lrulb. This word is here used ιο introduce a strong
reason for what has just been said. In this sense it is common in
Livy and later writers, but is rare in Cicero. — Hannibalis: savored
Hannibal. — arguebant: subject is senatores implied in senatus. —
locutum: sc. esse. - Flaccum Valerium: the order coenoman,
nomen, where the praenomen is lacking, as here, is the more
primitive and colloquial, for the coenoman is second ιο the prae-
nomen in degree ol intimacy and would in this sense take its place.
This order Cicero regularly followed when the praenomen was
omitted, but Caesar adopted the later and more formal, mmen,
copnomen. In silver Latin both are used, with a tendency rather
,toward the latter.

2. ortum ab Saguntinis: Livy's statement in Chap. 6. 1, that
Hannibal was the litis sator, is the Roman view. Polybius, 3. 15. 8,
declares that Hannibal had sent word ιο Carthage that the Sagun·
lines were annoying the allies of the Carthaginians

3. Dum: Livy now returns to the history of the siege which was
interrupted at Chap. 9. 2. - fessum habebat: be found bis soldiers
wearp. This use of babeo in classical Latin denoted especially the
continuance oi the effect suggested, as in captam babet, Chap. 13. 6.
Itis used by Livy more loosely and later becomes a periphrasis for
the perfect or pluperfect tense and approaehes the auxiliary use
so fannliar ιο us, —iis: because militem is collective-stimu-
lando: placed between ira e'n bostis and spe praemiorum and used
with both. Meanwhile be binales their coarape by aroasinp tbem
οι one lime wilh anper apainst tbe> enemy, al anolber by bope os
reward. Ira bostiam could not mean “ anger towards the enemy,'’
but this meaning might be obtained by means of odiam, which is
derived from a transitive verb. ·

4. ut vero: introducing the elimax. - adeo: here in its usual
sense as introducing the antecedent ιο a result clause. - videretur
