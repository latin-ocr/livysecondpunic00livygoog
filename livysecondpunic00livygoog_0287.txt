chapter ³9.
ι Annuuss or Fusius

In the intervening chapters 7-39, the events subsequent to the
battle of Lake Trasumennus and preceding the battle of Cannae
are enumerated in detail. After the battle of Lake Trasumennus
Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator and began to dominate
the situation. Hannibal moved about through Umbria and
Apulia, then through Samnium and Campania, watched at a sate
distance by Fabius. This policy of Fabius was not satisfactory to
the more restless clement in Rome, who found a leader in Minucius,
the master of the horse. Minucius having secured a trifling suc-
cess, is made equal to Fabius, but on fighting a battle in which
he was unsuccessful is made inferior in command again. In 216
ac. L. Aemilius Paulus and C. Terentius Varro were elected con-
suls. The latter was of low birth and filled the rble of dema
gogue while the former was of high birth and largely influenced
by the advice of Fabius. On the departure of Paulus, Fabius
makes the address set forth in this chapter.

2. duo boni: these words, as also et moli, imply a condition,
i.e., if you were two yood consula, eto-indicente: without my
sayiny it. The prefix in is therefore negative. This is an old
use found in early poetry. —e re publica: to tte interest ostie
stote.

3. nunc: as things ore now, the usual adversative particle in
Livy when the real is contrasted with the unreal. - altera parte:
on one side, hals, ie. one consul; adverbial phrase modifying the ex-
pression republica claudente-claudente: = claudicante, so helptess,
lame. Compare the adjective claudus. - ac : = as. -iuris: with
idem, as Varro and Aemilius have equal power.

4. nescio an: lom inclined to think—hic: Varro.

ὅ, tuis: opposed to eius. — militibus: your own soldiers will be
aroused against you by Varro.

6. ominis: ie. bad omen—tamen: although Ι do not want
to refer to Flaminius - he was a sury (furere) only when he became
consul; Varro even before he become consul uas ruod (insanit). -

videat: G. 577.
