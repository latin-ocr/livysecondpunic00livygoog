with Hannibal and the main part ot the arma-vn: below
the arr. .

3. oculis animisque: either dative with obieeta or ablative with
immobiles. The ambiguity may be intentional and we may accept
the double construction—ut: wien'- trepidationem: panio,
object ot ardue. This refers to the Carthaginian army. — tumultu:
confusion. — misceri: turbari, — uas beinp thrown into disorder.

4. quidquid: - quantulumcumque, any panio, however amai. —
⁴ ipsi: the montani.— perniciem: Poenorum—diversis rupibus:
rocks on different sides oi the defile. See the use oi theword
diversus, Chap. 30. 2. This passage has been variously emended.
The early Mss. have peruersis rupibus. The later Mss. and old
editions have diuersis rupibus. — iuxta ae: - pariter ae. - in vias:
beinp accustomed to patha und to pathless repious aiilee. , The con-
struction is adsueti in. Cf. Book 24. 5. 9. ‚Livy uses the dative
· with adsuetus except in these two placcS, both of which are
regarded by many as unreliable. The reading of the Mss, inuia
ae devia, however, defles a reasonable explanation, os innius and
denus do not differ as the ac suggests. -

5. ab iniquitate: this construction strongly personifies the
iniquitate which is represented as fighting against them. Some
think there may bean error in the Mss, duc to the close proximity
of ab with hostibus, but oppugnabantur suggests an agent. — plus-
que: with certaminis below -inter ipsos: among the soldiers
themselves, ie. with each other. — quam: ie. piusque . . . quam.
—sibi quoque tendente: cf. Book 6. 3. 7, cumpro se quisque
tenderet.

6. infestum: used passively, so the sense is—the husee eu-
donpered the line. -repercussae: properly this word should not
refer to the means whereby the sound is thrown back, but to the
sound itself, so that it is used here lor resonantes ι reuerteratiup.
— stragem: the details are given in the sentences which follow.

7. turba: rather the tumultus or perturbatio turbae-in im·
mensum altitudinis: to a preat depth. Again a neuter adjective
with a partitive genitive, instead ol the attributive adjective and
noun, ef. Chap. 31. 2.—quosdam: as these are the'soldiers
the multos must in the main be linae (camp followers) and calones
(servants), who were with the beasts of burden. - et: = etiam.—
