soom, oi Princeton University.

Clota, r2nw, ιιι puger, 40 cents

The editor has aspired to interest and not to impress. Whatever
views learned men may hold conoerning the literary genius ol‘ ‘The
Ag ricola,” to the student the treatise makes' 1ts strongest appeal as the
story ol the lile ol a man ol affairs who deserved well ol his country in
a troublous age In the commentary therefore, the editor has more to
say about the historical and the political aspects ol the biography than
about syntectical and stylistic phenomena.

fessor raam< Garanum Momm, of Columbia University.

Clota, mmo, 249 puger, oo cents

The aim in the present volume has been to introduce the reader with '
the least possible iormality to the leading features oi Tacitus' style, by
presenting his more striking modes of expression, not as grammatical
curiosities to be viewed with indifference through the dusty glass oi a
museum case, but as highly specialized tools, shaped lor his own use by
the master- workman.

Medea. Edited by Professor Huosr Mrcmsrm husam,
oiWabash Collega. cl oth, 310 puger, oo rents

No attempt has been made' m this edition at a critical treatment ol
the text, but the arm throughout has been to give such aid as will en-
able an intelligent student ol average preparation to understand and ap-
preciate the plays themselves.
