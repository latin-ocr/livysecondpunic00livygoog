i. et cum . . . liceret: Livy pasees directly from the state-
ment of the omission from the treaty of a preventing clause to
the assumption that as such was lacking it was permitted to take
new allice-censeret: the question is rhetorical, but the mood is
determined by the mood ol the answer which would be potential
subjunctive and negative. G. 466, The tense is due to the concep-
tion oi its being asked in past time. — aut ob nulla quemquam:
or that no one on account os any. - tantum ne: rare lor modo nc, i
so a proviso but cast in past time, hence sollicitarentur and recipe-
rentur. In considering the menits oi the question it must be con-
