actually said, but what it seemed to him a man of a certain charac-
ter should or perhaps would have said under the circumstances
It must also b'e understood that the purpose of these speeohes
is ιο make the narrative more persoual and ιο secure an oppor-
tunity for a display of rhetorical skill, both of which prevent the
historical narrative from becoming wearisome. We must there·
fore consider the speeches from the standpoint of the historian and
not from that of the speaker, for they express his views and the opin-
ions of the people of his day. In this speech of Hanno, Livy
intends to impressori the mind of the reader two facts, set forth
in a preliminary abstract in ι 3 ; first, that Carthage knew that the
Romans would take vengeauce for Hannibal's attack on Saguntum
which was really aimed at Rome, and second that Hannibal, the
, firebrand, was the cause of all the trouble. These two ideas are
interwoven with great skill through this speech and undoubtedly

Rome in the better position in the general estimate of the re-

sponsibility for the conflict.

1. quoque: ie. as well as the attempted visit ιο Hannibal.

2. magno silentio: this is matched against cam adsensa and

infinitives depend on a verb of saying implied malleatoriam had
named, he said. Note the rhetorical omission of the connective
between the infinitives save at the close where nec joius quietare
(esse) foedera in ohlastic order to non manes, non stirpem con-
quiescere. Note that conquiescere and qaielara are not used in
the same sense. Hanno's warning is given in Chap. 3. -maneS,
stirpem: the entire family, dead and alive, are in active oppositiou
ιο Rome. Α striking expression, indicating the spirit prevailing
and persisting in the Barcine family.

4. flagrantem: this word with materiam igni and incendium
recalls the figure with which Hanno closed his first speech, Chap. 3.
Here he assumes that the incipient blaze has brought the con-
