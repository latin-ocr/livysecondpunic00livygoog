3. L. Cincius: see Introduction-moveret: particularly
influence ma Note absolute use oi moueret, or perhaps nra has
fallen out atter maxima-confunderet . . . . additis: confuse
ihc number by adding.

4. cum his: (lrc says ilat), includinp these. The infinitiva
adducta (esse) in Italiam, depende upon a verb of saying implied'
in auctor moveret, as this is a statement oi Cincius quoted by Livy.
—in Italia . . . sunt: Livy's opinion—magis: with verisimile,
virtually one word. Oi. vert similias, Book 5, ll. 7. lt is mora

5. audisse: subject, se, te. Cincius—ex ipso: Hannibale.-
aliorum: this word indicates that equos refers to baggage carriers,
not to cavalry, and the iumento were mules-amisisse: depends
on audisse. Polybius declares that aiter Hannibal crossed the
Rhone he lost 18,000 infantry, and 2000 cavalry,‘but aiter the pas-
sage of the Pyrenaea a total of 30,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.

that he came down among 000 Taurini, and that this lact ought
to prove the impossibility oi the route over the layum Poeninum,
that portion oi the Alps extending from the Great St. Bernard
south to the St. Gothard. Livy disregards the fact that Polybius
claims that Hannibal desoended among the Insubres, which view
permits the acceptance ci the route by the Great St. Bernard.
See notes, Chap. 31. 1. Ii, however, he crossed by Mont Canis or
Mont Genevre, he would have corne down directly among the
Taurini. -digresscz as lra come down from tha Alps.

6. magis miror: sor this reason l am still more carrariam.-
credere: the subiect is implied in the word 00090. The infinitiva is
parallel 00 ambiyr‘, and although not passive in form is so in sense
taken with culpa—Poenino: monte, rte. the Great St. Bernard.
The spelling is undoubtedly due to the tradition that the word
came from Poenus because oi the crossing oi tho Carthaginians
