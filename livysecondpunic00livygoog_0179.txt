, 1. In Hasdrubalis locum: this expression is not consistent with
the remainder of the sentence and there is probably a serious
corruption of the text. The best Mea. read praeroqativa militaris
. . . sequebatur. The sentence may be translated if we read
praeroqatiuam militarem . . . sequeretur, but it is unsatisfactory
because of in Hasdrubalis locum, which apparently needs some
words indicating the election of Hannibal by the soldiers.' The
sentence would then read In place o} Hasdrubal (tbc soldiers chose

follow.” ' ,· “

of the letters of arcesso. Ἴ Livy here and, in Chap. 4. 1, is following
the account of Coelius Antipater, ivho states that Hannibal went
to Spain on the summotis of Hasdrubal. This account implies
a return to Carthage after the death of Hamilcar, and is not
consistent with other statements of Livy in 21. 1. 4, and 30.
37. 9. In the latter citation Hannibal is represented as saying
that he left Carthage when nine years old and returned thirty·
six years later. Polybius also declares that Hannibal began his
career iri-camp in his ninth year. “f res: theproposalas to Hanni,¹
