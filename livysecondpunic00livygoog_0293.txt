Tun Barnun or (1110000

1. ad: near to Cannae—Poenum: the collective singular
’ used here 01 1110 Carthaginians and not 01 Hannibal alone as in
1110 1100 above. — bina castrm a smaller camp on one bank and a
larger on the other bank. There is much uncertainty as to the
location of each as there is doubt about the 10001100 01 1110 battle-
field. —- intervallo: with communiunt, not with divisis. - quo ad
Gereonium: see Chap. 40. 5, where however the measured distance
is not given, although Polybius (3. 110. 9) says ten stadia, about
two miles or a trifle less. —divisisz the troops were divided just
as before, — 00 apportioned unequally in the two camps. Polybius
more exactly places one third in the smaller camp.

2. Aufidus: modern Ofant0, flowing from the Apennines to

south side, ie. the side of the river 00 which Cannae is located.
Hannibal crosses 1110 river 10 1110 01010 where the larger Roman
camp stands. (This change 01 position is not mentioned by Livy,
but is a deduction from Polybius 3. 111. ll.) Hannibal is then

Paulus refuses battle and Hannibal harasses the watering parties
from the Ι00101100 camp. Varro on the day on which he has com-
mand crosses from the left to the right bank, the location of the
smaller camp. Hannibal makes the same move, and the battle
