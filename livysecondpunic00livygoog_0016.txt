INTRODUOTION

LIVY

Trrn Roman historian, Titus Livius, was born at
Patavium (Padua), the chief city of Venetia, in nc. 59, a
critical· period in Roman history, for in that year Julius
Caesar held his first consulship. Livy was born of a
noble family and was trained in philosophy, rhetoric, and
literature. Belonging by birth to a town which traced its
traditional history to Antenor, the friend of Aeneas, Livy
was a Paduan at heart and sympathized with the old
independent spirit of Italy. Nevertheless he was a
Roman and gloried in all that had been aooomplished by
the people of Rome and those associated with them.
In his youth and young manhood he had become familiar
with the struggle for liberty which preceded the battle of
Actium, and hence was a republican in spirit. In ao. 29,
or somewhat later, he carne to Rome and made that
city his permanent home. Augustus became his friend,
but styled him a Pompeian because it was known that
he admired Brutus and Cassius and questioned the value
of Caesar to his country; but it is evident that Livy was
satisfied with the imperial Government as it existed
under Augustus, After the accession of Tiberius, Livy
returned to Patavium, where he died in an. 17, having

survived Augustus by three years
