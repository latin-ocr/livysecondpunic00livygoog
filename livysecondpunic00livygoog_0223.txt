196 noras [cuir. so.

2. mirari: the infinitivo depends on versat animos which also
controls the indirect discourse construction of the remainder of
the chaman—pectora: Cicero would have used the preposition
in, but Vergil and Livy have the simple accusative with this verb.
-per tot annos: the outline oi the sentence is-va'ncentis . . .
stipendia facere neque . . . excessisse antequam . . . gentesque et
terrae Carthaginiensium essent. Note the present jacere as in·
dicating the action unfinished, and compare excessisse—duo:
the Mediterranean and Atlantia—diversa: here distant like
remotus, ci. Vergil’s litus diversum.

3. indignatos: agrees with eos, subject of traiecisse. — quicum-
que: rhetorical exaggeration, ci. Chap. 44. 4. In the speech oi
Hanno, Chap. 10. 11-13, the Romans are said to have demanded
Hannibal alone, but Polybius 3. 20. 8 says that Hannibal and his
councillors were demanded-obsedissent: preferred to expua-
nassent because the first embassy came during the siege.-
liberandumque orbem: anachronism—Livy is thinking of his
own time.

4. Tum: when they crossed the Fibra-id: the Journey—
visum: ie. cisum esse, depending on versat animos.

5.· occasu: from west to east. Note the singular of occasu and
the plural of exortus. The latter, a plural of instanceS‚ is poetic. —
emensam: deponent used passively as in Vergil; ci. expertus,
Chap. l. 2; depopulatus, 51. 43 and auspicato, 63. 9.- postquam:
the sentence outline is partem anensem cernant . . . Pyrenaeum
saltum superatum . . . Rhodanum . . . traiectum, (postquam) in
conspectu Alpis habeant, fatigatos subsistere. —Italiae sit: is a part
os Italy.

6. eredentes: agrees with the subject of subsistere, so that the
question is not expressed separately and assumes an abrupt form
for a rhetorical purpose. lt is this question that marks the change
from reproach to encouragement. — quid Alpis: belicvr'ny the Alps
to be what else but mountain hec'qhts t — altitudines: Livy uses the
abstract in the plural as concrete. He thus gives the idea of height
more prominence.

7. Fingerent: suppose they are hiqher than the Pyrenees. The
subjunctive is the indircct form for the imperative. —Pyrenaeit
Livy’s expression is Pyrenaeus saltus. Cf. 23. 4; 30. 6; 60. 9. —Alpis
