BOOK XXVI. CHAPTERS 1-15

The books intervening between the twenty-second and twenty-
sixth give the events of the war for the years 216-212 ac. The
operations are carried on in Italy, Spain, Sicily, and Africa. Livy's
narrative passes quite abruptly from one scene of warlike events
to another. The twenty-third book describes the movements of
Hannibal in Samnium and Campania ; his occupatiori of Capua,
capture of near-by Casilinum, and his attempt on Nola. Some at
tention is given to the campaign in which the Scipios are endeavor- ·
ing to defeat Hasdrubal. The twenty-fourth book is mainly
devoted to the operations in southern Italy at Crotona and in
Sicily after the death of Hier0‚ the friend of Rome. Hannibal
gives his time and attention to the capture of Tarentum and
loses ground in Campania. Casilinum is retaken by the Romans.
Marcellus in command ol the Romans in Sicily besieges Syracuse.
Syphax, king of Numidia, becomes friendly to Rome. In book
twenty-five we find a description of the siege of Tarentum. Capua
is now threatened by the Romans and appeals to Hannibal, who
moves into Campania. In Spain Hasdmbal defeats and slays
the two Scipios, Publius and Gnaeus, but is finally defeated by
Lucius Marcius. In Sicily Syracuse surrenders to the Romans·
The first fifteen chapters of Book 26 are concerned with the siege

of Capua.
