adiuvIssent: iterative subiunctive.—-adminiculis: refers to mu·

8. Iumenta: lt is difficult to explain Livy's picture. He
seems to have in mind a layer of newly fallen snow resting on the
old snow over which an icy crust had formed. The troops wore
away the new snow and slipped on the icy covering ol the old
snow. The beasts oi burden, however, cut at once into the icy
crust and finally by reason of their struggles broke completely
through, so that ln this icy crust, which was hard and frozen to
quite a depth, they were held as in a trap. The difficulty is caused
by Livy’s interchange ol glacies and aia when he is speaking oi
the second and lower layer ol snOW, and we wonder whether he
has in mind ice below the two layers of snow.

8. infimam nivem: we should expect inferiorem, but Livy has
evidently neglected the lact that he has spoken oi two layers of
snow and is thinking simply oi the extreme depth. — nivem: is
governed by ceetabuut.

chapter 37.

1. Alter struggling in vain to make their way over the ice,
they abandon the effort suggested in 36. 4 and place their camp
on the high ground, tecum, in the vicinity oi the rupes, over
which the road must be made. -iumentis . . . hominibus: the
reverse order ol that in the preceding chapter.

2. ad rupem muniendam:=udoiom muniendam per rupem. See
note t 1 in preceding chapter. What is the origin oi the expres-
sion munire eiam = to make a madi—arboribus: this is not
contradictory to nec stirpes circo radicesue, Chap. 36. 7, which simply
refers to the icy suriace over which they were struggling. —ardenua
. . . putrefaciunt: this statement has stirred credulity almost
from the time ol Livy. Polybius does not mention the incident.
Pliny the Elder in his Natural Histlory, 23. 57, and 33.71, refers
to the theory in these words: edices tque et aceto rumpunt. Other
writers mention the incident ; Silius Italicus III. 642, excoquitur
flammis scopatur, Juvenal, 10. 153, montem rumpit aceto,¹ Ammi-
anus Marcellinus, 15. 10. 11; and Servius to the Aeneid, x. 13,
quos aete exustas aceto infuso rupit. Appian, VIII. 14, gives the
details even more completely than Livy. Some suggest that the
