chapter ³0.
Hnuurnnn’s Annaeus

This speech is an excellent illustration of Livy’s power as a rhet·

orician and is well worth careful study. The opening sentence
represents Hannibal as swaying the rninds of the soldiers by rc-

proof, castigando, and by encouragement, cohortando. This is the
outline of the chapter, for at first his words cre reproaehful, tem-
pered to be sure by compllmentary references to their achieve-
ments. Afterward he encourages thern by belittling the difficulty
of crossing the Alps, which form after all only a prelfminary ob-
stacle, for beyond is Rome, the great object of achievement. This
is the elimax and the line of thought is as follows: As the Alps
have been crossed by othere, so they may be crossed by the Oar-
thaginians who have surmounted other difficulties 3 and as Rome has
been taken by the Gauls, so it may be taken by the Carthaginiensi
who had captured Saguntum.
