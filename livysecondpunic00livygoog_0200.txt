begins by stating his errand and placing the responsibility for it
on Alco, their fellow-citizen (civis, emphatic), who has failed to
complete what he undertook, as he has not brought the terms oi
peace from Hannibal which he went for. Alorcus declares that ,
he has therefore come out of interest in them, being their guest
friend. He did not suggest peace as long as he saw that there
was hope of their success. With such an introduction as this

on the ground of necessity. His last sentence pictores the disaster
which non-compliance with these terms implies.
