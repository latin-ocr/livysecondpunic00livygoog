the botterinp roms (ories, collective).—coeptae (sunt): regularly
when the passive infinitive follows the verb coepi, the passive form
is used and exceptions are rare. Tacitus however disregards this
use. G. 423. 3; H.B. 119. 2.

3. abundabat . sufficiebant: note the chiastic order. The
parenthesis ad centum creditur also forms a chiasmus with obun-
dobot . . . Poenus. We may imitate this in the following
rendering, —there were many menon the side os the Carthapinions,¹
obem one hundred ond fifty thousand it is penmolty believed, but
the townsmen, sor puardinp every point, aster they bepan to be scattemd
in manuplares, were not sufficient in numbers.

4. coepti: ic. postquam coepti sunt.

ὃ. Itaque iam feriebantur: this is the next step in the progress
of the siege-una: uno (pars) opposed to multoe partes. One
port os the wall, by a continuone breach, hod uncooered the city sor
on attach—tres deinceps turres: three towcrs in succession. This
phrase explains the continentibus ruinis. Notice again Livy’s
fondness for placing such a word as deinceps between tres and
its noun, ci. tanto circa supa above. This is similar to the Greek
attributive position.

6. ruina: hereconcreteasshown byquo. . . procursum est. In
all languages certain nouus which denote abstract ideas are ulti-
mately treated as concrete. Naturally in the course oi this change
the plural would be used as concrete first, as den'oting instances,
and then this use would extend to the singular. This is fully
exemplified in Livy in the case oi ruina and ruinae. —qua: ad-
verb oi locality ior ruina ie. the brooch. And here, just as is the
wall hod protected both aliha, they (the besieped ond besiepers) rushed
to battle—velut texisset: the conclusion of this condition is im-

· plied thus, uelut procursum esset, si texisset. G. 602, A. 524.

7. quales . . . solent: such os commonly lohe ploce in assoults
on towns, when either party hos o fauorable opportunity. — conseri:
from consero, -ui The idea is “uniting in combat'’ as from -
sero, to sew. The same verb is used of joining war to war in
10. 4. Sero, sevi, to sow is used figuratively oi sowing discord
in Chap. 6. 1. — iustae acies: regular line oi battle, contrasted
with tumultuariae popone-inter ruinas: between the ruins o]
the walt ond the buildinps which stood o short distance from the wall.
