Professor Jonas C. Eonnnr, of Columbia University‚ General Editor.

The guiding principle which the editors have uniformly kept in mind
throughout this series is that the books shall serve the real needs of the
students for whom they are intended. Elaborate introductions and
learned notes have been rigorously excluded. “ The noles ore written io
instruct ond noi to impress.'’ They combine sound scholarship with
brevity and conciseness. Ι The low price at which the volumes are issued
makes it possible for the teacher to require his students to buy a larger
number of books from which to select his readings.

Professor WALTER Damon, of Swarthmore College.

FROM THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE

“This edition of Livy was prepared to meet the needs of students,
and the editor has made such selections from the first Decade and has
placed in the Introduction and Notes such information as the members
of his own classes at least have seemed to find interesting. In order to
encourage a more extensive reading ol the history ol Rome, parallel
references to the modern handbooks will be found at the beginning ol
the Notes on each section of the texts. it is hoped. that the student
will be impressed by the fact that in reading Livy he is privileged to
study a first-hand source of information. The list of modern historians
is so long that in every college library will be found at least several of
the books recommended. it is hoped, also, that the teacher will re·
quire of his students especial care in pronouncing proper names. To
this end the Index Nominum was prepared; the English method of
pronunciation is strongly recommended. But lew grammar references
are given in the Notes because it is believed that the student should
read his Livy rather for the pleasure ol reading and cultivation of his
literary sense than for a mere study of the peculiarities of Latin syntax,
although the latter is important and some attention must be given to it.’'

This volume, together with “ Livy, Book ΧΧΙ,” edited by Professor
James C. Egbert, offer to the student at a low price and in convenient
form a wide and comprehensive selection of the work of Livy.
