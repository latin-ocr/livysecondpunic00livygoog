risis] Ι noras 165

8. Hinc spes: Livy first assigns spes to one side and desperatio
to the other, and then explains each by the use ot the ablative
absolute construction. -aduitatur2 the conclusion is in cepisse

:capturos sore which is an anticipatory perfect and so future in Α

idea. A. 516. e. The direct formiscepe', si adnitar. cf. Chap. 44,
“ii this is well fixed in your minds you have conquered, ie.
you will have conquered.’' —patria: ior urbe as the Romans
readily identified the two irom their own experiencc —Sagun
tinis . . . opponentibus: tlte Sayamtiaes 'platina their bodies
as an obstructiora im behais os their city stript os its walls, no one
withdrawiny e step lest he should let the enemy into tlte procedre
linquished.

9. inter arma corporaque: ie. the weapons either pierced the
shields or struck the bodies of the combatants. This is shown by
the sentence si haesisset im scuto nec penetrasset tn corpus, below.

10. Phalarica erat: the Sapunttnes had a missile, tlte phalarica,
arith a sitast of piae-cetera: the accusative of respect. In
Ciceronian prose this accusative is limited to a iew words, vicem,
partem and auid. The use is extended in the later writers espe-
cially with words denoting parts ci the body, also with such words
as cuneta, omma, alia, cetera. As it occurs in early Latin in the
neuter ol several pronouns (id, aliud, qaod) it is colloquial, and
its use is encouraged by the influence oi the Greek language where
this accusative of respect is common. — ld: ie. extremam—sicut
in pilo: modifies quadratum, “square form.''

11. habebat: the subiect is phalarica, the obiect sermm.-
cum armis: like the Greek dative oi accompaniment “arms and
all.'’—id: looks forward to the qaod clause by which it is explained.
—haesissct and penetrasset: subjunctive of repetition, not con-
dition. .

12. medium: this is the same as extremam which becomes the
middle of the spear when the iron end is included in the length.
Hence it was the part bound with tow and smeared with pitch.
The accusative is the same as cetero above, and semar in Chap. 7. 10.
-quod . . . praebebat: because when 11 was discharaed with the
middle portion set on stre aad bore the fleme, which had been kiadled,
samned into a fiercer stre hythe very motion, it compelled tlte soldiers
toabaadoa their armar and exposed them to the blows which followed.
