Piens 6, 7.]

chapter 7.
Tan Sinon or Secunrau

The description of the siege has been likened to a tragedy in
five acts. It extends irom Chap. 7. ta 15. 3, but the continuity
oi the story is broken by two episodes, the first of which describes
the visit of the Roman envoys, Chap. 9. 3 to 11. 3; the second
gives an account ai the endeavors of Alco and Alorcus to bring
about a truce, Chap. 12.,3 to¹ 14. The entire description is in
Livy’s best rhetorical style and as a Roman he purposely empha-
sines and elaborates the details of the siege which he desines his
readers to regard as the cause oi the war just beginning, and thus
endeavors to place his countrymen in the right.

1. Dum parent: incomplete coextension, hence dum with
a present tense. G. 5703 Α. 556. - Saguntum: this is the Latin
form of Ζάκυνθος, Zacynthus made in the days when the Latin
alphabet did not have a Z nor use ΤΗ ior θ, and when Ghad its
original value G. Hence in transferring this word ta Latin,Z
was represented by S, κ by Ο with value G, and θ by T, and finally
vby V. The o was represented by Ο which later became an V when
the ending oi second deciension changed from om to um. Zacyn-
thus is the transliteratibn of the days of Livy. It was one of the
Ionian islands now Zante. Saguntum is now called Murviedro
(muri veteres). “

2. Oriundi: agrees with cives implied in avitas. This is an ad-
jective derived from oriar, and is a favente word with Livy.
The inhabitants came originally, as the story goes, from the uland
os Zacynthus and there were minpled aaa them some of Rutulian
origin from Ardea. —Rutalorumx depends on peneris=pantis.-

⁸ Ab Ardea: this prepositional phrase is similar in its use as an

attributive of Rutulorum to ab Hermandica as attributive oi pro-
fugi in Chap. 5. 7. Ardea was an old town of Latium south oi
Rome, hence Livy may have endeavored thus to account for the
Roman ailianae.

3. ceterum: here resumptive, taking the reader back to lanae
opulentissima in t 2, and explaining it.. Livy suggests three expla-
nations for their growth in wealth, placing as the climax their regard
for their obligations, which in Livy's day had become proverbial.
