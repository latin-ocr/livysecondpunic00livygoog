1. angustiorem: than the road in general, which has just been
described as angusta. -rupem: this word must here mean the
clitl ol rock which thopeth traverses‚ and is opposed to sanis

esset or measse esset circumducere. Hence the subjunctive is relied
upon to give the idea oi tbe necessity of the act. There seemcd
to bc no doubt tuat ht would be compelled lo lead bis army around by
