cognitum cst, so that writing simply as he thought, hc has actually
left crudele without its verb. Hence we should supply suit, which
the sentence demands. Some regard modale as attributive to
imperium and neceesarium as predicate and give ceterum the force
of tamen.

4. cni: note the usual construction with the impersonal passive
porci. — anim: shows that this is the explanation of the preced-
ing. It was this Livy had in mind when he wrote cognitum eat. -
ante: to be taken with quom, from which it is regularly separated
when followed, as here, by the participle and when the principal
clause is negative. We know that the city was not entirely de-
stroyed and that a remnant of the inhabitants survived. For
Livy tells us that it was taken by the Romans and the former
inhabitants were restored (24. 42. 10 and 22. 22. 4).

of the destruction of things of velue, and Livy explains by means
of the quamquam clauses—discrimen: cf. Hannibal's order,

prior to that of redactum esse.
2. constat: i is agreed that c laryc amount os money was
realized.
³. The remaining sections of this chapter deal with chronological
difficulties occasioned by the statement in Chap. 6. 3 that P.
Cornelius Scipio and Ti. Sempronius Longus were consuls —i.e.
that it was in 218 ac. — when envoys were sent to Rome to ask
for aid before the siege. Livy perceives the difficulty when he
combines eight months of the siege with the time of wintering at
New Carthago and the five months’ joumey of Hannibal into
Italy followed by the battles of the Ticinus and the Trebia. Either
these events required shorter periods or the beginning of the
siege was considerably earlier or the battle at the Trebia occurred
