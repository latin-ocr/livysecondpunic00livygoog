together in cohorte, but with spaces between the maniples. We
must keep in mind the character oi the Roman line oi battle.
There were three lines; first, the hastati, then the principes and then
the triarii. Each of these was divided into ten manipuli, and a
number ol vetites 'or skirmishers were attached to each com-
pany. Scipio arranged that not merely between two cohorte
was there space, but between the three maniples ol the
cohort‚ and this space ran through the entire arrangement
of the three lines, although usually the principes stood in the
intervals back ol the hastati. Translate, marcover he did not
arrange tlte cohorte in continuans line each before its own standards,
bnt he separated all tire maniples with internata between thern.
In battle the standardS, sipna, are in the last line of the man-
ipleS‚ so that the soldiers (the hastati and principes) fight before
the standards. qua: adverb referring to spatiani-acti: ie.
