See Book 21. 62. The Saturnalia was celebrated ior one day as an
old Italian festival, as early as 497 aa, but now it was given
greater importance perhaps because of the additional the convi-
ctam and the lectisternium as directed by the Sibyllina books which
were oi Greek origin. Here was a combination oi a foreign reli-
gion and that of ancient Rome. Julius Caesar gave three days to
the celebration.

THE CARTHAGlNlANS IN THE MARSHES OF 'PHE ARNO

1. dilectu: dative. — proiectus: goes back to Chap. 1. 1, where
in a few words Livy refers to the attempt to go over the Apen-
nines, described so minutely in Book 21. 58. Hannibal's aim was
Arretium. He could rcach the place by several passes oi the Ap-
ennines; of two of these one is said to be more convenient but
longer; the other, nearer. Just which routes these were we cannot
say. He selected that route, however, which was more direct
and which finally led over the marshes oi the Arno, In Chap. 3. 6,
he refers to Faesulae as the place which he reached after cross-
ing the marshes, Does Livy mean that this shorter route was
over the Apennines, or over the swamp, or a combination oi the
two? Some question whether the swamp is that ol the Arn0, and
suggest the Po, as Strabo (v. l) says, and others believe. -ex
hibernis: near Placentia and Cremona.

2. qua: adverb. This clause modifies propiorem aiam petii. -
solito magis: G. 398, n. l; A. 406. 21.—inundaverat: lead over-

flowed.
