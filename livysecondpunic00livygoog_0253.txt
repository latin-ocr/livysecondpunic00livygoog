7. donec: immediately following uenerat is not quite logical and
the idea ol aad it so continued must be suppliedz—circumvecti:
from circumvehor. - paulum: with circumuecti. — Is pavor: terror
at tiis. - auxit: the subject is uulnus and likewise periculum. —
propulsatum: the participle gives an added idea and the expres-

the meaning is tlte rest os the cavalry. Others take alius as set oli

< 10. quod: directly governed by tradidere, and not by obtinuit
(lias beeri maiutaiued), which is intransitive. The quod stands lor
a filio servatum consulem esse which is implied in de filio verum
esse. —fama2 this word repeats the idea of plures tradidere and
hence Rieman-Benoist supplies ea before sama. This lessens the
abruptness of the latter part of this sentence.

1. There is considerable uncertainty as to the movements of
the two armies after the battle of the Ticinus and up to the battle
of the Trebia, and hence there is uncertainty likewise as to the
exact location of the latter battle. Livy states that Scipio
marched from the Ticinus to the Po, and croLssing the river en·
carnped near Placentia; and that Hannibal, following the Romans,
