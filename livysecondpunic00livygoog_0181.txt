he passas on to Hannibal’s own qualities, which are described in
the twofold relation of a subordinate soldier (parendum) and a
commender¹ (imperandum). This double reference is continued
in imperatori aa exercitui, in Hasdrubal praeficere malle . . .› militae
confidere aut audere, and in plurimam audaciae and plurimam
concilii. All this is supported by an enumeration of other
characteristica generally arranged in pairs, carpas . . . animum
patientia. . . modum vestitas . . . arma ‘atque eqai; princepe
. . . ultimae. Against this is set the Roman view as a foll to the
favorable description and finally the chapter closes with a sen·
tence containing the same double reference to Hannibal as a
soldier (caruit) and as a commender (laturo daci).

Missus: the prominent positiones this word calls attention to
the fact that, in spite of the protest of Hanno, Hannibal was
sent to Spain. ’

2. credere and intueri: historical infinitives as used in de·
scriptione, so also malle and confidere aat audere below, Each pair
of infinitives gives the particulare of the circumstance stated in the
sentence preceding-vigorem in vultu vimque: alliteration is ³
often used by Livy when making an effective combination of
words-habitum oris lineamentaque: same expression aad tte
same leafares¹ -pater in se: lilaeaeaa fo his lathem¹ se is abl.

3. Numquam: never was the came nature better adopted to datiea
⁴ aa opposed—parendum atque imperandum: gerunds in opposi-
tion with rec, a usage rare until Livy. —discerneres: the sub-
junctive of the indefinite second person, potential, placed in the
past, increases with the development of the language (G. 258 ; Α.
447. 2; Η.Β. 517. 1). Found rarely in early Latin, it becomes
common in Livy. ’

4. quemquam: not aliquem, as the sentence is negative.-
fortiter ae strenue: this combination of the qualities implied in
sortia and strenuas represented the Roman ideal. lt is a favorite
collocation in Livy, but is found in other writers as far back as
Cato (GelliuS, Noctes Atticae, 17. 13. :at-ubi . . . agendum
esset: the iterative subjunctive which is common in Livy but rare
in Cicero and Caesar. lt follows the simple relative, also cam, ai
abi, etc. (G. 567 note; A. 518. c; Η.Β. 540).—a1io duce: abl.
