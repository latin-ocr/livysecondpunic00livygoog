15. Sempronio: according to this chapter t 1, his two legions
had wintered at Placentia and yet in Chap. 59. 10 Livy says
Sempronius went to Luca in Etruria. This movement to Luca
— if it occurred at all -must have taken place aiter the wintering at
Placentia. ⁷ Flaminius is said to have taken command at Ariminum
and then the army was led into Etruria. So that according to Livy
the army marched from Luca to Ariminum and then back again
over the Apennines. 1f we omit the march to Luca, the order oi
events is consistent. Some suggest that Flaminius may have
taken command at Arretium and not at Ariminum. - est coeptus:
as Flaminius is logically the subject of the ablative absolute we
should expect exercitum ducere coepit.
