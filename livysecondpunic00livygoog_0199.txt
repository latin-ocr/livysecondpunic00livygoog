Livy apparently ignores the discrepanoy between the first sen-
tence of this chapter and the first statement of ᾖ 13 of the preceding.
His object is the rhetorical effect.

1. cives: his own propte, ie. the, Carthaginien army. It is
opposed to hesma If it is used with exactness as in Chap. 5. 5, it
indicates only that portion of the army which could be spoken of
as his follow-citizens. These would be the first to feel the absence
of the commender. ·

3. Temptata: Thea two persons, Alco of Serpentum (so of Greek
. origin) artri Alorcus a Spaniard, tried to realize some hope os peace,
which (however) was very slipbt. At this point, when the final
catastrophe apparently is at hand, Livy interrupto the narrative
as at Chap. 9. 3. The rhetorical effect is marked, for at the critical
moment Livy speaks of a ray of hope for this brave but unfortunate
people.

4. aliquid: aco. of inner object. The subject of moturum is se

· to be supplied—postquam . . . movebant: imperfect indicative

with postquam to denote a continued state or ar. incomplete action.
After their teors could accomplisb aotbiriy. — ut: as was to be er-
pected from oa oayry victor. - ferebantur—offerebantur. — trans-
fuga: deserter ond rtet on intercessor—moriturum: sc. eum esse.
Livy frequently omits the subject of the infinitive, especially the

· future.

5. Postulabatur: commemorantis were-singulis: this means
in addition to those they wore, as is shown by birris aestimatis,
Chap. 13. 7, and other references to the same custom: 22. 6. 11;
23. 15. 3.

6. leges: terma-animos: spirit. Note the plural of the
abstraot noun as the idea pertains to a number of persons. -aliaz
ey. their arms, the fortifications.—interpretemt in its earlier
