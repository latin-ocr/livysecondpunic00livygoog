Cnnr. 44] NOTES' 261

declares that the smaller camp was on the east (south) side of the
river, and that the battle was fought on the same side as the
smaller camp (3. 113. 6). Polybius says east, thinking ol the
river as running south to north, whereas it actually runs from
southwest to northeast.

The other view follows Livy a little more closely. He does
not mention the double orossing of the river by Hannibal, but
only the crossing before the battle (Chap. 46. 1). After Hannibal
goes to Cannae, the Romans follow and locate near him on the
south side of the Aufidus but place a smaller camp on the north
side. Hannibal attempts in vain to allure Paulus to battle, but
sends Numidian cavalry across the river to attack the water parties
from the smaller camp. Varro, succeeding Paulus in command,
crosses the river and draws up his army in battle army, Hannibal

likewise crosses and the battle takes place on the north side of ,

the river. The obiection to this latter view is the statement of
both writers that the Roman right rested on the river and that
they looked south during the battle. As to the first it was truc
that the right rested on the river in the first position. Afterward
the Romans wheeled around to face the Carthaginiens, who, took
up a position with their rear on the river. The Romans thus
were facing almost south, at least southeast. - ripa ulterior: aa

the southern bank as viewed from the smaller camp.
