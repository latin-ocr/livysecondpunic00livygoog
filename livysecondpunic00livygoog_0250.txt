subjunctive is used in prohibitione and gives the impression oi
intense emotion. -at liberum: this is a reading suggested by
Kraus in 1875, Rhein Mus, 30. 324. Compare also dumam popa·
lorum libertus servaretur oi Chap. 2. 7. The Codex Puteanus and
many editions have ad Hiberam esi Saguntum which must mean
“ Saguntum is on the Ebro,” and must be understood as declaring
that it was not to the north oi the river. To secure a sensible
interpretation more readily, others have suggested al cis Hiberam
esi Saguntum and at riori ad Hiberam cst Sayuatrim. In Chap. 2. 7.
Livy declares that a treaty was made by the Roman people with
Hasdrubal that the 'Ebro should be the boundary between the
possessions oi Rome and oi Carthago in Spain. As Saguntum was
one hundred miles south oi the Ebro, this would place Rome in
the wrong as to Saguntum, unless some special clause was added
protecting that city. This additional clause, therefore, whether
in the original treaty or not, was vital to the question oi the right
ol Rome to interfere with the Carthaginien attack on Saguntum.
itis this question which forms the subject oi the dialogue, and
we can readily see how the uncertainty as to the reading has
arisen. Itis very probable that Livy was ignorant oi the exact
location ol Saguntum as he speaks of the town as midway inter
imperia duorum populorum, Chap. 2. 7, and hence may have made
the statement cd Hiberam est Sapiniam.

7. Hispanias: anachronism, as the division oi Hispania into
Citerior and Ulterior was unknown in Hannibal's day. —autem:
this is the corrective autem used in questions. The Latin term is
correctio the Greek epaaorthosis. It is the tense, however, which
is corrected and not the meaning. —miseruntt they did not actu-
ally go. — nihil . . . relictum: nothing hasbeen lest, and sowe shall
have nothing, — hence the future perfect in the protasis. -vindi-
carimns: ior vindicaverimus.

8. illis: Romans—timidis: dative in the predicate aiter csse
agreeing with illis. This is the more common construction in place
ol two accusatives, A. 455. 2. a. Compare this construction with
necesse est below. — sua: quos is logically the subject oi the sen-
tence although syntectically the object, A. 301. b.-dnbitat:
wasers. The implication is, oi course,inclinati0n toward the enemy.
An euphemistic statement.
