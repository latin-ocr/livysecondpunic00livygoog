. 4. quibus si: qni si cis, the relative pronoun, whose ante-
cedent is tepatos and whose verbs are denuntiarent, traicerent,

. and deferrem, is drawn into the preceding clause and receives the

construction appropriate to that clause. —et, et, ac: note the
three connectives. The ac brings the emphasis upon the queri-
monias deferrent. — sociis: Mommsen sets the date of the alliance
as 226 n.c., J'ust before the treaty referred to in Chap. 2. 7.

b. hac legatione decreta: the preceding sentence, purposely left
incompleta for rhetorical effect, is briefly summed up in these
words. The technical name for the figure is aposiopesis, ic. an
abrupt pause—necdum missa: Polybius says this embassy, ·
“ to look into the affairs of their allies,’' was actually sent. It met
Hannibal at New Carthage in the winter before the siege and then ¹

· went on to Carthage. Polybius makes no mention of an embassy

which acted as here described by Livy. — omnium spe celerius:
sooner tban any one expected.—spe=exspectatione.

6. alii: there are three different opinions which are indicated
by alii, alii, and erant qni. The verbs are censebant, intendebant,
and censerent. Livy aims to avoid monotony.—intendebant:
stands for intendendum censebant as it. corresponds to rem peren
darn censebant. .

7. exspectandosque: the que is adversative because of the
negative preceding. -eo maturius: the eo refers to the character
of the opinion which prevailed. As it. was resolved that a waiting
policy should be followed until the return of the envoys from Spain,
the sending of the envoys should be more speedy.

8. si non absisteretur: the apodosis of this is in the inde missi
(irent) Carthaginem. The direct form would be inde ite Cartbagi-
nem si non absistatur—ad ducem deposcendum: this is Livy's
favorite method of expressing purpose. lt is varied here with
in poenam, an instance of the final use of in, which is common in
Livy, and occurs in ante- and post-classical writers-foederis
rupti: concrete noun and participle in place of the abstract noun.
