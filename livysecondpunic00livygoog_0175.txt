oi qued it is definite, “the war.'' The Romans may not have
noticed the difference. Here the special war, ie. the Second
Punic War, is pointed out by the words Haembele duce. —gessere
is not regarded as a logical part of the sentence, simply as explana·
tory, hence it is in the indicative meod and not subjunctive. Ι

2. opibus z a broad tem, reeourcee, but more explicitly given
in the statement ot the second reason-inter se contulerunt
arma: met ie aren. — virium eut roboris: atrenqtb tor attede end
beurene sor defense. — inter sese : this, the usual form oi recip-
rocal expression, may be taken with egrotos, which is preferable, or¹
with weserebaet. —expertss1 deponent participle used es a
passive. —et adeo z ared ee coneus was the fortune oi war end so
doubtful the contest. — Mars : lor “war” as Venus ior “love” and
Bocchus lor “wine''—qui vicerunt = victores. — tuerint: the per·
ieet subjunctive is the regular sequence in clauses of result aiter
a secondery tense, to denote the final result.

Poenis, and this opposition is marked by the asyndeton. Livy
places victoribus with victi ior contrast—crederent: this does
not give the reason, and the point of the sentence may be seen in
the English rendering, because they were reled, as they thought.
The use oi crederent emphasiees the responsibility oi the Cartha·
giniens and is stronger then ii the verb imperitare in the subjunc-
tive had been given alone. -superbe avareque: what did Livy
have in mind i— victis : dative with impersonal passive, imperi·
totum esse.

4. Fama est : this expression shows that Livy here turns from
recognized laets to nn incident not necessarily worthy oi credence.
The sentence in outline is lamo est H annibalem . . . altoribus ed-.
motum . . . iureiurando adactum esse. It illustrates Livy’s pic-
toresque way of deseribing an incident. The young boy, seeing
the sacrifice and learning its purpose. begs to be taken along, and
when the request is granted is himseli bound by an oath. Hence
