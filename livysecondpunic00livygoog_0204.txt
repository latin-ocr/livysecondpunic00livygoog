in the following consulship, that oi Cn. Servilius and C. Flaminius
(217 a.c.). Livy declares the last suggestion impossible and
vleaves us to choose from the other two; but from Chap. 30. 9
11 is evideut that he believed the siege required eight months.
The facts are that Hannibal besieged Saguntum in the consulship
of M. Livius Salinator aud L. Aemilius Paulus, 219 rac. Cornelius

and Sempronius were consuls after March 15, 218, and the battle ’

of Trebia was fought iu this consulship. — quam: for postquam
postis omitted in Livy after an ordinal (Lease).-quidam: notably
Polybius 3. 17. If Livy had consistently followed Polybius,
he would have avoided trouble. — Carthagine: 11. Nova Cartha
piae. - scripsere: Livy prefers this form in his earlier books but
shows a growing preference for the forms in -crunt, after the
seventh book and as his work progresses (Lease, la'cy, p. xxxii).

4. Ad Ticinum: the account oi this battle is given in Chap. 45,
that of the Trebia in Chaps. 55, 56.

6. excessisse: cannot hove sallem—pugna ad Trebiam: so.
facta. Livy is fond of J'oining the prepositional phrase directly
to the noun. This is another instance of a preference for the
condensed expression. — quia: the historian gives as a reason for
the necessity of assigning the battle of the Trebia to 218, the
supervision of the election oi the consuls of 217 by Sempronius,
who went to Rome for this purpose after the battle of the Trebia.
So as to identify this election beyond mistake he names two inci-
dents, the entrance of Flaminius upon his consulship at Ariminum
and notat Rome (Ohap. 63. 2), and the retum of Sempronius
to the army (Chap. 57. 4). We should expect quia C. Flaminius
