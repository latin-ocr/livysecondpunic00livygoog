BOOK XXVII. CHAPTERS 40-51

The episode presented in this section sets forth the battle of the
Metaurus River and the defeat of Hasdrubal. This brother of
Hannibal had been in command in Spain and had managed to
defeat Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, and there was prospect of the
entire subjugation of Spain to Carthage. In 211 ac. Publius
Scipio was sent from Rome to command the army of Rome in
Spain. The center of interest, therefore, after the fall of Capua
is the Spauis‘h campaign, which was carried on with renewed vigor.
Hasdrubal, however, eludes Scipio and starts for ltaly to join and
aid his brother Hannibal. This great general was still successful
in the face of his loss of prestige because of the abandonment of
Capua, and the Roman general Marcellus was caught in an ambus-
cade and killed. The crisis of the war is at hand, for Hasdrubal
¹ passes rapidly over the Alps and threatens the Romans from the
north. lf the two great Carthaginian armies should unite,
Rome's doom was sealed. He'r last armies were in the field,
her great commandere had perished‚ there was reason ior great
discouragement. Fortunately for Rome,¹ the messengers. of
Hasdrubal to his brother Hannibal fell into the hands of the
Romans. The consuls Gaius Claudius Nero andMarcus Livius
Salinator united their forces and surprised and overwhelmed
Hasdrubal at the Metaurus River. Thissbatue and the events
leading up to it are presented in the closing chapters of Book 27.
