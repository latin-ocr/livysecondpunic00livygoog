6. id . . . propius: if we accept the view that the battle was
fought on the north or left bank, we must assume that this was
the Romans’ first position, which was at right angles to the river
facing northeast‚ and that there was a change as they swung
around to a battle line facing the southeast. — propius: with the

The gender is determined by the predicate noun which stands next
to it. Apparently Livy’s statement here refers to two divisions
of the line dextrum cornu and laevum cornu, the ad medium mean-

ing merely “ at the middle of the line.'' Then the pedites after
deinde refers to the Roman legions mentioned two lines below.

Below in i 8 there isa threefold division. If we do not identify
thepedites after deinde with the Roman legions, the latter, the
legions, may be considered the middle of the line and we have a
triple division—Gemino Servilio: the order here is cognomen,
acmen, which is the older form when the praenomen is missing and
is due to the substitution of the second personal name-copaomen
—for the first. This is the order in Cicer0, but in Caesar the order
nemea, copaomea prevails and later writers vary the usage, tending
rather to the latter form.

8. medic: the Roman infantry and allied infantry, or simply
the Roman infantry designated as tepiditas—data: est.
