1. Iam ver: the spring oi 217 ac. In Book 21. 58. 2, Han-
nibal is said to have led his army into Etruria at the first sign ol
spring. Apparently he was baffled, nequiquam ante conatus, by

his experience in the Apennines, as in Chap. 59. 1, he returns to the -

vieinity of Placentia. At the opening 'ol this book he sets out
again probably lrom Placentia, for although he is said in Chap. 59.

factory, and events oi the entire chapter are questioned. They
were probably taken irorn some annalist, for they are not given by
Polybius. — ex hibernis: at Placentia, as indicated above. — movit:

strategy. -errore: possibility ol mistake, uncertainty as to his
