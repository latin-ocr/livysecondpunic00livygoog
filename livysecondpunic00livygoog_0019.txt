torum antiquissimas according to Livy i., 44. 2,-wrote

’ canolas in Greek which began with Aeneas and ended with

¹the close of the Second Punic War (xxii, 7. 4 ; 57. 5).
Another was L. Cincius Alimentus, propraetor of Sicily
210-208 rac, who also wrote in Greek. Having been a
- prisoner in Hannibal's camp, he knew of the Carthaginians
by actual contact (xxi, 38. 2). Valerius Antias of the
time of Sulla wrote, in Latin, canales in seventy-five books
covering Roman history from the earliest times to his own
period. He was not an accurate writer, and it is unfor-
tunate that Livy relied upon him. He quotes Antias
’ thirty-five times but questions his accuracy in later books
L. Coelius Antipater, re erred to three times in xxi,
38. 7; 46. 10 ; 47. 4, and once in xxii, 31. 8, lived in the
early part of the first century Bo. He composed, in Latin,
an interesting history of the Second Punic War in seven

. · books, using as an authority Silenus, aGreek historian who

culture, and his style showed a marked improvement over
that of the early annalista, so that he is favorably men-
tioned by Cicero, Brutus, 102; De Oratore, ii. 54. Of
the writings of these annalists we have only fragments now
extant. M. Porcius Cato, 234-149 aa, who is styled the
Father of 'Latin prose, because he first wrote Roman
history in Latin, was apparently disregarded as an au-
thority by Livy, who quotes him once (xxxiv, 15), and
declares that Cato would not dim his own glory when
mentioning the number slain in battle. Livy might
have used Cato's great historical work, the Origines,
which from the fourth to the seventh book gave a his-
tory of Rome from the First Punic War to his own
time. There are various theorias as to justx how the
