indicated evil to come. —apum: the more usual opium is also
found in Livy.

from speculandas. —- obvius fit: plural is also found in Livy where
a singular subject is amplified by carn and its noun. G. 285.

on the wings and the Spanish cavalry in the center. See Chap. 44. 1.

6, vixdum: with sublato. Scarcely bod tbep raised ilie battle cry

— vidissent: subjunctive of repetition. -ad pedes: the plural of
pes, so the expression means od pedestre certamen. The fiplrt lind
now become in preat port an infantry battle.
