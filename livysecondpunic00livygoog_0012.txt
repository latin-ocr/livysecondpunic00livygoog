ans book has been prepared with the defini-te purpose of
placing in one volume the twenty-first book of Livy's History
and those sections of the third decade describing the most
important episodes of the Second Punic War. The selec·
tions, therefore, include the twenty-first book, the descrip-
tion of the battles of Lake Trasumennus and Cannae (Book
XXII), the siege of Capua (Book XXVI), the battle of the
River Metaurus (Book XXVII), the battle of Zama (Book
XXX). The commentary is intended to be of direct aud
definite service to the studente of the freshman class No
attempt has been made to furnish anything original, save in
the method of presentatiou aud in avoidance of noteS, cross
references and citatione, which hinder rather than help.
The editor does not regard the continual use of the lexicon
as necessarily a valuable exercise. Assistance is therefore
often given by supplying special meanings of words, par·
ticularly in the latter part of the book.

In the twenty-first book, attention is called to the manner
in which Livy forms his sentences and chapters. Through-
ont the entire cornmeutary there are occasional references to
manuscript readings so that students may form an acquaint-
ance, however slight, with this side of classical study.

The text is mainly that of Weissenborn-M. Muller. The
editor is indebted to the many editions which have preceded
this, particularly to those of Weissenborn, Wdlfflin, Rie-
mann and Benoist, Riemann and Homolle, and also to the
editions of Lease‚ Dimsdale, and Henry.

The proof has been read by Professor D. P. Lockwood, to

whose scholarship and common sense much is due.
