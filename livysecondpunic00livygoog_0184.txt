upon item: - stipendio imposito: this abl. abs. gives an additional
fact, from the point of view cf the Carthaginiens; an abrupt
change which shows the less formal style. — victor: substantive
used as an adjective. This is an early use found in the poets
and common in Livy. -Carthaginem llovam: the word Carthage
means “new city,”¹ hence there is a doubling due to the neglect
ol the original meaning of the word. Gi. the English “blacke-
moor.’' This city is the modern Comagena-nibem: the
winter of 221-220 nc.

b. lbi large partiendo: ibere by a free distribution os tlte spoils
und by tlte faithful discharge of all arrearapes of pay. -stipendioz
this word in the preceding sentence meant tan, here pay of a soi-
dier. —animis in se firmatis: strenptlened in their loyoby. The
way in which this was accomplished is given in the partiendo
and exsoluendo. - bellum promotum: again a sudden change in
point oi view, for the first part of the sentence leads us tc expect
momouit. These abrupt changes are simply an evidence of the
freer and less formal use oi the language.

7. Ab Hermandica profugi: Livy frequently has the preposition
ab before the name of a town where classical usage would call
for the simple ablative. This use is characteristic of the language
ol Livy and comes from the speech of the people·. The use of
prepositional phrases and adverbial expressions as attributes is
also characteristic of Livy' s style. It may be the result of poetic
or Greek influence. Profupi is an instance of an adjective used
as a noun. This language custom of employing adjectives and
participles as substantivas is considerably extended in Livy.
. Cicero uses a few adjectives thus, when designating a class, as
. boni, docti, mortales. In the case of profugi, as elsewhere, there is

' a verbal force so that ab Hermandica profugi is equivalent to ei
aui ab Hermandica profugerant. Cf. 19. 5, receptos in fidem
= eosqui in fidem recepti essent. -cum se iunxissent: in clauses ·
of this kind the tempora] noticn has almost disappeared and
they conveniently take the place of participial constructionis
(G. 585; A. 544; Η.Β. 524, a).

8. procul Tago: the usual prose formis proculab. Livy uses
the condensed form so that mucul virtually becomes a preposi-
tion.
