CHAPS. 41140] uorus 267

general statement meaning “the midst 01 the battle.'’ The Nu-
midians are not the 500 but those named in j 1. — fugientis: this
probably means the equites sociorum just put to flight (compare
terror aa faya) whom Hasdrubal left the Numidians to pursuc
while he himself turned to attack the Roman infantry. This is
more 111 000010 with the statements of Polybius, 3. 116. 7-8.

Chapter 49.

In this chapter as in the preceding Livy’s description 01 1110
111000ον010 10 full 01 difficulties and is obscure. Evidently hc ¹
has based his description 011 11101 01 Polybius but has also intro-

eamest or with a sarcastic touch, —that he might just as well
have done s0, for being without horses they are now in his hands.

- quale: = tale quale esse debuit or 0000 solet. — victoria: ablative
absolute.

5. paucos: = equos. Compare omissis equis, in 1 2.

6. praetervehens: the present participle 01 praetervehar, used
as if that verb were ⁴a deponent whose present participle is the
