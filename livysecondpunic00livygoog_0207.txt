Chapter 18.
Dactaaa'rrou or Was

1. The chapter opens with the sending of the second embassy
from Rome and closes with the formal and tragic declaration oi
war as a elimax. The first embassy had bluntly demanded the
surrender of Hannibal. This embassy suggests the question of
responsibility for the siege of Saguntum, since any reply will lead
appropriately to a declaration oi war. This method ol approach
is therefore uerbis leuior but rc asperior. The argument of the
speaker runs as follows. We do not recognize the question oi
responsibility as pertinent, for that rests with the country con-
cerned. lf we assume, however, with you that the question ol the
responsibility oi the ‘general is pertinent, you did not recognize
the authority of Lutatius in treaty-making. Therefore we should
not be held for the action of Hasdrubal when making stipulatione
as to Saguntum.-— legatos: the framework ol the sentence is
legatos . . . mittunt ad percunctandos . . . ct . . . ut iudicarent.
Note the two ways of expressing purpose- publicone consilio:
ou the authority os the state. This phrase occurs five times in the
chapter, and as equivalents Livy uses nostro arbitrio, eu auctoritate
patrum . . . populi iussu. The other side is expressed by suo
consilio, priuato coucilia, suo arbitrio, sua sponte.

araceum (esech should aoy iu dascusa thet u uas· douc. The
infinitive depends upon defenderent as upon a verb of saying.

4. praeceps: peremptorq.— et prior: even your former embassy.
Polybius does not mention an embassy during the siege, but in
3. 20. 8 declares that at this time the surrender oi Hannibal was
demanded on pain oi war. Livy has apparently followed different
authorities in making up his story. He certainly has made the
account very effective- tamquam oppugnantem: on the prouud
that he uas besiepiuq. G. 602. 3, 4; 666 Ν.- cum . . . depos-
cebatis: this is the explicative cum with the indicative, which is
used because the action oi the two verbs is simultaneous. — adhuc:

cruel in purport. Note adversative asyndeton.
