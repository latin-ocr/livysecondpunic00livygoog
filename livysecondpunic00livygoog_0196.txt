a treaty led to disaster—Tarento: an ee parte statement, for, from
Polybius, 3. 26, we learn that the Carthaginians were not forbidden
by treaty to sail to Tarentum. At, that time Italia would not
include Tarentum. . ¹

9. vicerunt: the emphatic position as we should expect but
taking the place of victi samaa because Livy desires to shift
the attention to the di who have helped in a righteous cause. —
id . . . ambigebatur: asto the matter os dispate. When Livy used
id, he had in mind a verb like diiudicarit which· would govern the
acc. case. He substitutas uictoriam dedit, and the construction
changes; id is left without any construction, and we have an
anacoluthon-unde: is pronominal for a qao and contains
the antecedent of ei. The Romans said stare ab aliquo, “ to stand
on the side of any one.''

10. ln a remarkable passage Hanno shows how the operations
against Saguntum are simply preliminary to a general war with
Rome which will result in the siege of* Carthage. Livy is of
course acquainted with facts unknown to Hanno—Carthagini:
in emphatic positi0n; it is Carthage, not Saguntum, which Hannibal
is besieging. Next Sagunti is emphasized as contrasted with aos-
tris—the walls oi Saguntum will fall upon oar heads; and finally
cam Saguntinis is matched with cum Romanis and we have the
climax, — war begun with Saguntum must be waged with Rome.

11. Scio: 1 know my influenee e'a his case is insignifleant because
os my balred os his father. Hanno had a personal hatred because
the army had preferred Hamilcar to him in the war with the
mercenaries. Polybius, 1. 82. — Sed: but eren though thie be so
Ι can say that Ι aas pled when Hamilcar died aad I hate this sery-
os-war-with-a-torch ia like manner. - tamquam: prepares the way
lor the figurative expression.

12. dedendum (esse): and the other infinitives depend on the
idea oi thinking in detestor, the omission is rhetorical and due to
the impassioned statement. - in ultimas oras: Livy writes here
with a knowledge ot the fate oi Hannibal.

13. Ego ita censeo: a technical expression as used in the Roman
senate. Now we have the suggestions for which the speech has
prepared us,- Rome must be pacified; Hannibal must be sur-
rendered—Hannibalem: used so as to avoid ambiguity since
