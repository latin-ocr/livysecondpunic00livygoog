x INTBODUCTION

character, and Quintilian (x, . 39) mentions a letter in
which Livy urges his son to study the speeches of Demos-
thenes and Cicero. These, however, have disappeared.
Livy's great work, according to the grammarians and the
manuscripts, was entitled Ab urbe condito libri, but he
began with Aeneas, and in xliii, 13. 2 he speaks of his
history loosely as annales. In his preface, however, he de-
, clares that he began with the founding of the city, and we
must remember that annales is a general term. He began
writing his history about rac. 26. It is evident that the
work appeared in sections of a varying number of books,
There were originally one, hundred and forty-two bookS,
of which thirty-five are extant. At the beginning of
Books vi., xxi, and xxxi, we find prefaces to the new
portione, for Book v. ends with the burning of Rome by
the Gauls; Book xvi. began the First Punic'War; Book
xxi, the Second Punic War; Book xxxi, the Macedo-
nian Wars. These facts led the copyists to refer to a
division into decadeS, cle. groups of ten books, which are
first mentioned at the close of the fifth century. There-
fore‚ some have believed ina publication of decades or
'semi-decades, but it is justas convenient to divide the
forty-five books into groups of fifteen; thus, i.—xv., Ae-
neas to Punic Wars; xvi-xxx, Punic Wars; xxxi.-
xlv., Macedonian Wars The thirty-five extant books
give the first, third, fourth, and half of the fifth decade ; .
the i.-x., Aeneas to the end of the Second Samnite War
(293 ae.) ; xxi-xlv, the Second Punic War to the end
of the Third Macedonian War (167 n.o.). Books xli.
and xliii. are not complete. We have a page orso of
Book xci. and a fragment of cxx. and brief summaries,
periochae, of all the books except cxxxvi. and cxxxvii. ;
