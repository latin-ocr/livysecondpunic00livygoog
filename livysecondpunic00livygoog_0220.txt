7. ex composito: according to agreement. This phrase is very
familiar in Livy and is read here for the Ms. loeo prodito, and for

the uncertain loco edito commonly adopted. -fum0: ablative of Α

means.

8. iere: opposed to pers magna. The cavalry iu penerel hed
lurqer boets because cs the horsea. This was necessary only in a
few cases for many of the horses swam. See l 9. -adversi . . .
fluminis: tlte soree os the current. -parte superiore: crossiu'p ouer
bichor up the river.

9. nantes: agrees with the collective pars muana which has a
plural verb.

'chapter 28.

1. Gelli occursant: Livy opens the chapter with a reference to
the scene on the bank described at the beginning of Chapter 27, and
to the crossing just portrayed. He does this so as to introduce
the account of the manoeuvre of the Carthaginians under Hanno
’ who now attacked the enemies' rear.

2. et ex adverso: the et corresponds tc the et before ium. The
second et is not in the Mss. but is supplied by Riemann, for other-
wise etex adverso would lack the corresponding phrase, et .· . .
ab tergo which we expect. These following the Mss. begin a new
sentence with ium and declare that Livy changed the entire phrase-
ology after writing et ee adverso. — traicientes: agrees with suos.

4. utroque . . . conati: eudeauoriup to mulce au attach against
both. -postquam2 with the indicative. G. 562.

ὅ. Livy first declares that there were varicus schemes for taking

the elephants across, but corrects himself by saying that at least
the accounts differ. Hc then gives two methods but rejects the

first, that of Coelius Antipater, and supports the theory oi Polyb·
ius-refugientem nantem: both of these agree with rectorem
understood. This is the manuscript reading and although the
lack of connective may seem harsh, yet the proposed alternative
readings are less satisfactory. Other suggestions are refugientem et
e'n oque nutantem and sequeretur, cuntem where nantem must agree
with elephantum although Livy apparently did not believe ele-
