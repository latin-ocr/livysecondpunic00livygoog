1. Haec derecta percunctatio: this straiplttsorward inquiry aad
declarationes war. The percunctatio is suggested in Chap. 18. 3,
but the denuntiatio is described in chop, 18. 13, 14. — verbis dis
ceptare: to debau. This is opposed to armis disceptare implied
as likely to follow denuntiatio. -excisat supply urbe in apposi-
tion to Sapunto, or we may regard Sapunto as feminine from a nom.
Sapuntus.

2. llam: this sentence with its elaborate explanation makes y
clear and justifies the position oi the Romans which might other-
wise have been misunderstood, as they had made no reply.
- quid: in what respect uus tlte treaty os Hasdrubal to be compared
raith tlte famer treaty os Lutatius ultim was chanpedl-esset: q
this is an unreal condition. Nevertheless, if si . . . res sit. quid
. . . comparandum est were thrown into past time, the form would
bethesame as that used here. G. 596. 2; Α, 516.2.b‚f. For
comparandum crat G. 597. 3a; A. 517. b.

3, ratum fore: this infinitivo is due to the verb of saying im-
plied in additum esset. Censuisset stands for the lut. perf. indic·
ative, which was the form in the treaty. -in Lutati foedere:
opposed to in Hasdrubalis saedere as indicated by the adversative
asyndeton. — fuerit: this word and comprobatum sit show a change
in sequence due to the author’s desire to represent the question
as a persona] observation made by the writer at his time. — mu-
teretur: in result clauses the imperfect often follows the pure
perfect. G. 513, Ruu.

4. quamquam: corrective, and pet—'etsi . . . staretur: even
if they should stand by tlte first treaty. -stuseturz this is unreal
condition and as such is due to the author's rhetorical purpose.
—cautum erat: the mood is due to the actual existence of the
provisicn, no matter whether they stood by the treaty or not. li,
however, si priore foedere stetur, satis cautum est should be trans·
ferred to past time, we should find the forms as here given] There
isan ellipsis in the sentence. lj theystood by tlte former treaty, (it
would malce no difference) sor prouision liud already been made.
