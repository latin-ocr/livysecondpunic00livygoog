1. These chapters torm a digression essential to the narrative,
as reference must be made now to Sempronius and his career
immediately preceding the battle ol the Trebia, at whi'ch contest
he was the commander. - interim: refers to that part ol the war
described in Chaps 26-48 and not to the period of the cessation ol
hostilities (constitisset). —Italiae: after imminentes—Sem-
pronio: see Chap. 17. 1-6.

2. missae: either supply suat, as the punctuation in the text in-
dicates or regard the ccccm, octo, ‘tres as partitive appositiou to
actori· quinpuiremcs. -Liparas2 as insula Vulcani is one oi the Lt-
x parcae tasciae, we should not expect the plural to be used when the
word is set off against the name ol an island of the group. Hence
scholars have suggested that the word Liparas here stands lor the
largest island of the group or ior the town upon it. ln Chap. 51. ¹
3Livy refers to these islands as insulae Vulcani. We must not,
however, expect exact geographical designations in Livy. For
the absence of the preposition see G. 337 Rem.; A. 428. c, e. —
tenuerunt: supply curarim—fretum: the ships were sailing
from Lilybaeum (see ᾗ A) on the west end ol the Sicily, east to the
Lipari islanda. The aestus, either the tide or heavy sea, —perhaps
caused by the tempestas referred to in t 5,—drove them out of
their course into the Fretum Siculum, the Straits ot Messina. ⁴

3. adeas conspectas: = act earum conspectum. The preposi-
tional phrase is a substitute for a cum clause. Hiero in the early
part cf the First Punic War was a friend of Carthage, but afterward
became a devoted ally of the Romans. —Messanam in portum:
for preposition see A. 428. J'.

4. cuius: tlte flcet to which they belcapad, A. 307. e.- petere:
depends on copottcm est, so csse and credere.

6. Μ. Aemilio: Sicily was assigned to the praetor M. Aemilius
as his department when Sempronius went on to Africa. See
Chaps 17. band 51. 1.
