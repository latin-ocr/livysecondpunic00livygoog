before they could cross. There were two divisions oi the Carthagin- ’

iens, one under Hannibal, the other under Mag0, his brother. These
two divisions atter a march to the west ot two days bridged the
river and then turned east to Placentia where battle was offered, but
declined‚ and the Carthaginians then encamped about seven miles
from the Romans, Scipio moved from Placentia to the west, across·
the Trebia and occupied the hilly ground inaccessible to cavalry.
Thus Scipio ison the west side of the Trebia and Hannibal ison
the east side. Some believe that Hannibal intended to keep
Sempronius from J'oining Hannibal. Livy does not suggest this.
Sempronius succeeded in joining Scipio. Just before the battle
Hannibal allures the Romans across the river and the battle was
fought on the east side. The objections urged against this
view are the fact that Scipio intervenes between Hannibal and his
base ot supplies and the ease with which Sempronius J'oined Scipio.
Those with whom these objections have weight say that Scipio
when moving to Placentia did not go near the town, but encamped

somewhat at a distance and west oi the Trebia. This would
