auidas or Mauso ichen they last confidence in thern, merely quess-
inq the raud, they entered dcfiles at randum. The necessity oi this
long explanation seems hardly apparent, unless we accept the
theory that Livy found it difficult to explain the long time used
lor a short journey. His difficulty arises tram the fact that he
has taken his data imm several authorities.

t. stativa: castra, so not a one-night encampment.

6. Vergiliarum: Vergiliae is the Roman name ior the Pleiades.
They set in the west J'ust before sunrise on October 26. Livy
thus attempta to explain the fall ol snow, but he is probably in
error again, ior thereis not sufficient time between October 29
and December 21, the date ot the battle ot Trebia, lor the events
which took place. Livy did not know that snow talla in the
Alps earlier than the date given. The latter part of September
is more consistent.

'l. pigritia: slaqaishness aad hopelessuess were eaideat ia the
features os all. - signa: with praegressas .

8. promuntorio: a projectitia height. — prospectus: distant aaa.
This is an extraordinary statement apparently based on Polybius
lll. 54. 3, as no place in the Alps where Hannibal could have
crossed atiorded a view as here described. Livy with a rhetorical
purpose thus sets torth that in the near distance is the goal oi
their hopes. This explanation is supported by the double use
of ostentat, which governs ltaliam and campos, but with forae ol a
verb ol saying controls transcendere and fare.

9. moenia: the idea oi the Alps sarving as walls for Italy had
already been suggested by Cato. cetera plana: an appropriate
expression, although not physical in application, as is shown by
aaa et altera praelia. What remaias cett be simple aad easy, literally

level and down hill. — summum: at the mast.
³ 10. furta: figurative for “ stealthy attacks,'' so “ ambuscades.”

11. ab Italia: on the side of ltaly. Note the torm of expres
sion—multo: with difficilius—ut: as.

12. sustinere . . . vestigio: could not lceap themselves from sall-
iaq, aar coald those who had once stamhlecl retain their firm saathold
(haerere adfici vestlpia). Some read adflicti, which is contradictory
toqui titubassent, which implies ellort to prevent falling. — que:

aad thas.
