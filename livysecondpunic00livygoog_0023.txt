of the plans of Hamilcar for vengeance, and his intentions

Manuscripts and Editions. —The manuscripts from which
we obtain a knowledge of the third decade of Livy's his-
tory are very numerouS, but we rely chiefly on P, ic. Codex
PuteanuS,dating fromthesixth century and numbered 5730
in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris. As the first por-
tion of this manuscript is missing, there remain of Book
xxi, chapters 20. 8-21. 13; 29. 6, 30. 113 and from 41.
13 on. Hence for Book xxi. we also use C, ic. Codex
Colbertinus of the Bibliotheque Nationale, dating in the
tenth or eleventh century, and the Mediceus (M), eleventh
century, of the Laurentian library at Florence. These three
manuscripts, with others of later date, and with early edi-
tions—cp. Editio Frobeniana (1531), which gave us
readings of a lost codex, - furnish us with the textos the
third decade. The earliest printed editionis dated in
Rome, 1469, but the first critical edition is that of J. F.
Gronovius of Leyden (1645). There are many modern
editions of various parts of Livy's History. The complete
. annotated edition of Weissenborn, revised by H. J. Mueller,
Teubner, Leipsic, is the most useful. This appears in
parts, new editions continually replacing the old. There
are a number of excellent editions in English of xxi—xxii,
which are fumished with an elaborate introduction and
commentary. The best known of these are by Lord
(Boston, 1892); by Greenough and Peck (Boston, 1893);
by Westcott (Boston, 1904) ; by Le e (Now York, 1905).
For a study of the syntax arihzstyle of Livy, the
most convenient essay is found in ease's Livy men-
tioned above. The most elaborate work is Riemann,
