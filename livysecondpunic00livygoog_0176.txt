Pica 1.] NOTllS 149

ceamnp his father io falce him arith him. — annorum : gen. of quality
with a proper noun where we expect pueram. This joining of the

quality directly to the noun shows the tendency of the post-
Ciceronian prose toward the more concise form. - Africo bello:

war with the mercenaries.—traiecturus: when on ihc point ol
leading aa armyranner. Livy uses the future participle freely as
expressing likelihood, intention, and at times as an apodosis. '
This extension in the use of the participle is one method of giving

’ greater flexibility te the language. — tactis sacris: abl. absolute!
The Latin follows the order of occurrence, - he is brought to the
altar, places his hands on the victim‚ and takes the cath. -hostemz
Appian, the Greek writer of Roman history, living in the early
part of the second century An, in his Wars in Spain, makes a
statement similar to Livy's- “he would be an enemy of Rome
when he arrived at man’s estate.’' Polybius, 3. 11. 7, has “he
would never be a friend to the Romans,’' and is followed by Nepos,
Hannibal, 2. 4, numquammeinamicifiacam Romanis sore. Livy '
uses the same negative form in 35. 19. 3, numquam amicam
fore papali Romani. The positive form, hostem fore, as used here
suggests aggressive war.

5. Sicilia Sardiniaque amissae : tlte loss ol Sicily and Sardinia.
The concrete noun with the participle takes the place of an ab·
straet noun, for the idea of the >abstract noun is given in the par·
ticiple. The preference of the Romans for the concrete is shown in
the frequent use of res, so desparatione reram. —spiritus: genitive.
— nam ε for (he thought itai) Sicily had bean abandoned arith teo
ready despair. A free use of the indirect discourse, hence the in-
finitive construction (concessamease) going back to the thought in
angebant, which, as the tense shows, indicates the state of Hamil· .
car’s mind while performing the action of the preceding sentence.
Ii answers the question immediately suggested after the closing
words hostem sore papale Romano, ie. why did Hamilcar have
such hatredi The nam introduces the explanation of the refer·
enee to his feeling in regard to Sicilia and Sardinia—inter
motum : ie. during the bellam Africam mentioned above. - insu-
per imposito interceptam : note alliteratioir and assonance. The,
tense of imposito indicates a time relation te the main verb,
which is the same as interceptam.
